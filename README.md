### About me

As an experienced IT professional with 3 years of experience in the field, I have a diverse background in various roles such as IT Manager, IT Support, and IT Engineer. 

I recently graduated from INT college's DevOps course and have gained in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience with a wide range of DevOps tools and technologies.

This, combined with my experience in IT, has given me strong problem-solving skills, technical knowledge, and a good understanding of how IT teams operate.

I am now excited to apply this knowledge as a DevOps Engineer, where my goal is to help organizations streamline their software development and deployment processes.
